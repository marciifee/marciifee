### 🌸 Aloha! I'm Marc 👋
My name is Marc Langenberg — I’m an IT specialist with a focus on cybersecurity and cloud solutions, and the creative mind behind my passion project CosplayGIF.
I am currently following the path with exam to become as an IT-Security Specialist / geprüfter Berufsspezialist in Informationssicherheit (IHK), deepening my expertise in secure system architecture and compliance.

For more than ten years, I have also been deeply involved in the cosplay and convention community — working voluntarily as a division and team leader at DoKomi from 2014 to 2024.
The unique energy, creativity, and passion of the cosplay scene have inspired me ever since and continue to influence both my technical and creative projects today.

With over a decade of professional experience as a photographer and retoucher (for brands such as Ulla Popken, Douglas, and dm, ...), I can combine creative with technical strengths together.
My journey from digital film production to commercial fashion photography and IT allows me how to merge creativity with technology in secure, smart and innovative ways.

Some technologies I enjoy working with include:
Kubernetes, Docker, Microsoft M365, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Workspace, Cloudflare, Active Directory / Entra ID, Python, PHP, Proxmox, Wazuh, OpenVAS, MITRE, Zero Trust, SIEM and XDR — among many others.

I am still at the beginning of my career, constantly learning, building, and exploring new ideas.
If you’re interested in collaborations, creative tech, or security projects, feel free to reach out — I’d love to connect! 🚀
